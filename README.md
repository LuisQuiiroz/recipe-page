Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?

  [Here](https://recipe-page-q.netlify.app/)

- What was your experience?

  my experience was a bit tricky as i'm not very good with layout and i don't handle pseudoclasses very well

  I learned to use the pseudoclasses and design an ordered list of instructions, as the challenge required it.
  
- Your wisdom? :)

  Everything is possible with patience and creativity
